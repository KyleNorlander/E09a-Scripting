# E09a-Scripting

The object was to add labels to the game and to code them to work through the different nodes we created. With this assignment we have a very basic framework for a "Breakout" style game. The player has three lives in total. Upon losing a life, the player may then click to shoot another ball from the paddle to continue. Different color tiles gives the players a higher or lower score based on the color. Once you run out of your three balls the game is over and "Game Over!" is promptly displayed in the center of the screen. Great assignment!
